## 前言
嗨，我是Kris，歡迎來到我的專案Drunken Cake。以下是一些關於本專案的介紹，包含瀏覽前的環境建置與專案說明等。

## 環境建置
本專案結合前端畫面呈現與後端資料庫資料讀取兩部分，因此請連同node (https://github.com/Kris0201/node) 此專案一併下載，並視需求開啟mySQL資料庫，方能正常使用，詳細開啟專案方式如下：

1. 將本專案與上述提供之node專案一同下載到您的電腦中
react:  <https://github.com/Kris0201/react-topic.git>
node： <https://github.com/Kris0201/node.git>

2. 下載好後以vs code(Visual Studio Code)編輯器開啟，並分別於兩個專案的終端機輸入指令
`npm i`


3. 執行完安裝後，若欲看到完整資料庫資料，可至node專案中的"data"資料夾中下載所有sql檔

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
